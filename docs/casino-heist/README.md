# Casino Heist

This heist has three main ways to complete it. Each one, has its own pros and cons and you have to work on different taks before doing the
heist. In this guide, we try to explain how to make it properly. This heist can be painful if you don't do things on the right way.

## Common notes to all approaches

- Don't kill people when they are not expected to be killed.
- Do only the needed setup missions.
- Always take the cheapest gunman, and the cheapest driver.
- Always take the most expensive hacker, it gives you **more time** when taking the money.
- Leave the treasure room before the timer ends, otherwise you'll fire the alarm and you may die.

## Silent and Sneaky

This approach is based on a silent approach, this means, your team should not kill every guard and you should be clever on how to do it.

### Setup missions

These are the recommended setup missions you should do before the heist. Optionally, you may want to complete the Duggan mission too, just in case heist goes wrong but you still want to complete it.
