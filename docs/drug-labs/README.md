# Drug labs

These are business where you can work on drug production, and later on, sell the generated product. There are different kinds of
business to make money: cocaine, meth, weed, fake money, and fake documents.

## Requirements

- Buy a MC Clubhouse from Maze Bank Foreclosures. Location does not matter and does not affect business.
- Buy one or more labs from the computer you will find on the clubhouse. Before you do, please read this guide.

## Business enhancements

- **Factory improvements**. This improves the speed and the value of your product. The most important one.
- **Professional workers**. By default, your workers are low quality workers, making them profressional ones will increase the value of your product.
- **Security**. This only reduces the possibility from being attacked by NPCs.

## Basic steps

1. Buy or steal base ingredients for your product. Workers will use this to produce your product.
2. Once your product bar is full, it's time to sell the product.
3. Sell the product. There are plenty of missions, they happen randomly.

## Best locations

There are different locations for your business. The closer to the city center, the more expensive they are. You should take the most expensive ones, they worth the value in the long-term. Your jobs will be easier than using the Paleto Bay locations.

## How much money they can make

When selling our products we can choose between 2 buyers. It is recommended to choose who offers more money to get the best profit from the stock, even though we will have to travel a longer distance.

The following table represents the full stock value of each lab, depending on the selling point, and the estimated generation time if it is equipped with the personnel and production improvements.

| Lab type   | Nearby location | Far location | Generation time     |

for getting started.

## Tips

- Own an Oppressor MK II (fast and better spawn for MC) and/or a Buzzard, your life will be easier.
- Do not perform resupply activities unless you are homeless. These missions are usually not fast, so it is better not to spend time on them and to buy supplies and let the goods be generated while you do other activities. This does not apply to the fake document business since the profit is so low that it is not worth it.
- **(ADVANCED)** Once you have an Arcade business you will be able to acquire the **Master Control Terminal** which can be used to resupply all your labs.
